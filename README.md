# Oriented Matroids

This package contains an oriented matroid implementation for sagemath.

## Current version

The current version is 0.1.0 and is compatible/has been tested with sagemath 10.0, 10.1 and 10.2. It is in beta and is open for testing from others.

**NOTE:** This package will be integrating into SageMath directly. If you see any errors while using this please, open an issue and let us know so we can correct it.


## Installation

### Installation from Pypi
Use `pip` to install the package:

```
$ sage -pip install oriented_matroids
```

### Local install from source
Download the source from the git repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/thecaligarmo/oriented_matroids.git
```

Change to the root directory and run:

For convenience this package contains a makefile with this and other often used commands. This file neds updating to your sage installation directory before running.

```

```

### Common errors

1. If you get "SSL" errors, try the fixes found on: [ask sagemath](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/51130/ssl-error-using-sage-pip-install-to-download-a-package/)
2. If `make` didn't work, make sure you updated where your sage directory is in the make file.


## Using the package after install
After install, you can start sage and run the following command to have all methods available:
```
from oriented_matroids import *
```

## Uninstall
To uninstall the package you can run the following command
```
$ sage -pip uninstall oriented_matroids
```

Alternatively, if you installed locally and want to uninstall using `make`, you can run:
```
$ make uninstall
```

## Documentation
To make the documentation, you can use `make`:
```
$ make doc
```

To refresh the doc, I would recommend first cleaning it using `make clean` before running `make doc` again, just in case.
